## MetaMorpho

**Romans 12:1-2** reveal that the Apostle Paul clearly saw the world and spiritual forces as having a formative and shaping power. They are active agents of influence morphing us into a distinct shape. There are two very stark realities here that Paul tocuhes on regarding to the process of transformation. 

There are shaping forces before us and we are easily molded. As a matter of fact we are so plyable and soft as social creatures that we can only choose who we will be shaped by not whether or not we will be shaped. Being influenced and beat into a distinct form will occur but we can choose to tap into richer and higher influences. 

I want to explore in this set or articles the principle of transformation. How does a person change and how are we (in terms of our identity) fashioned and built. We are all becoming.
